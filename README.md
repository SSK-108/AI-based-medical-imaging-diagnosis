# AI-Based-Medical-Imaging-Diagnosis
AI-Based Medical Imaging Diagnosis Objective: Develop an AI model to diagnose diseases like pneumonia from medical images such as X-rays, utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to build an automated system that can assist radiologists in identifying abnormalities in medical images.
